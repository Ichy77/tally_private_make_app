# tally_private_make_app
I've developed Make-Apps based on internal Tally-APIs. Happy to improve those apps together :)

As I am not an experienced developer, I am quite sure that things are 
a) messy
b) can be improved a lot

Things I'd like to improve:
a) The connection should handle the token refresh conditionally on time
b) the module's timeout should be increased from 40sec up to whatever is possible
