# tally_private_make_app
I've developed Make-Apps based on internal Tally-APIs. Happy to improve those apps together :)
Those apps have been created for myself to achieve some things I needed quickly. I have not developed them in a way to hand over to "a client" but I am happy to share what I've done and would love to improve them together.

As I am not an experienced developer, I am quite sure that things are <br />
a) messy <br />
b) can be improved a lot <br />

Things I'd like to improve: <br />
a) The connection should handle the token refresh conditionally on time <br />
b) the module's timeout should be increased from 40sec up to whatever is possible <br />
c) I've forgot error handling -> easy fix <br />
d) module's interfaces haven't been implemented <br />
